## Overview
The **Mindful Eating Backend** is a FastAPI‚Äëpowered service that blends behavioral data science with LLM.  
It integrates personality‚Äëdriven recommendations via two fine‚Äëtuned **LLama3.2** language models, using **Big Five personality traits** and **mindful‚Äëeating behavior classifications** to deliver daily, personalized tips.

This repository contains the backend for "A Personalized Digital Intervention for Promoting Mindful Eating Through Real-time Behavioral Analysis and Adaptive Feedback." This project, developed as a capstone project for my Master of Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University, aims to help users cultivate healthier eating patterns by providing daily, personalized tips.

The core innovation lies in leveraging Big Five personality traits and user-selected eating behaviors to generate adaptive feedback. I've fine-tuned two Large Language Models (LLMs): one to infer personality traits from user responses and another to generate customized mindful eating tips. The system is designed to move beyond generic advice, offering suggestions that resonate on a personal level.

The backend is built with **Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL**, serving a [React Native Expo mobile application (Mindful Eating Frontend)](https://github.com/samshad/mindful-eating-frontend).

## Project Aim

Current nutrition and eating apps often provide generic, one-size-fits-all suggestions, leading to low user engagement and motivation. This project addresses this gap by developing an AI-powered mobile system that:

*   Analyzes users' Big Five personality traits from questionnaires and eating habit descriptions.
*   Generates daily, behavior-specific tips aligned with the user's dominant Big Five trait and chosen focus areas (e.g., emotional eating, portion control).
*   Delivers these tips within a mobile application that encourages food logging, goal setting, and user reflection.
*   Provides a direct chat interface with an LLM for real-time, personalized advice on eating behaviors.

## Features

- **User Goal Management** ‚Äì create, update, and retrieve daily eating goals.
- **Personalized Tips** ‚Äì AI‚Äëgenerated tips informed by dominant Big5 traits.
- **Questionnaire Handling** ‚Äì capture user answers to refine recommendations.
- **JWT Authentication** ‚Äì secure access tokens for every request.
- **SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL** ‚Äì robust relational data layer.

## AI Models Used
This project ships with two fine‚Äëtuned LLMs:
- **big5‚Äëllama3.2** ‚Äì predicts a user‚Äôs Big Five trait values from free‚Äëtext input.
- **mindful-tips** ‚Äì returns daily mindful‚Äëeating tips tailored to the dominant trait and the user‚Äëselected eating behavior.

![Database Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samshad/mindful-eating-backend/refs/heads/master/assets/db-schema.png)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samshad/mindful-eating-backend.git
   cd mindful-eating-backend
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Configure environment variables
Create a`.env` file in the project root (refer to `.example.env`):
```env
DATABASE_URL=[URI to your PostgreSQL database]
SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=[URL to your Ollama server]
BIG_FIVE_MODEL=samshad/big5-llama3.2
TIPS_GENERATOR_MODEL=samshad/mindful-tips
```

### Database migrations
Run the following command to apply database migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```


## Running with Docker

This application can be easily set up and run using Docker, which ensures consistent environments across different development and deployment setups.

### Prerequisites
