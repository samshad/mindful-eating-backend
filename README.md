## Overview
The **Mindful Eating Backend** is a FastAPIâ€‘powered service that blends behavioral data science with LLM.  
It integrates personalityâ€‘driven recommendations via two fineâ€‘tuned **LLama3.2** language models, using **Big Five personality traits** and **mindfulâ€‘eating behavior classifications** to deliver daily, personalized tips.

## Features

- **User Goal Management** â€“ create, update, and retrieve daily eating goals.
- **Personalized Tips** â€“ AIâ€‘generated tips informed by dominant Big5 traits.
- **Questionnaire Handling** â€“ capture user answers to refine recommendations.
- **JWT Authentication** â€“ secure access tokens for every request.
- **SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL** â€“ robust relational data layer.

## Technologies Used

| Category          | Stack                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Web Framework     | FastAPI                      |
| ORM & Migrations  | SQLAlchemy Â· Alembic         |
| Data Validation   | Pydantic v2                  |
| AI & LLM Serving  | Ollama Â· Unsloth Â· LLaMA 3.2 |
| Containerisation  | Docker Â· Docker Compose      |
| Production Server | Gunicorn + UvicornWorkers    |

## AI Models Used
This project ships with two fineâ€‘tuned LLMs:
- **big5â€‘llama3.2** â€“ predicts a userâ€™s Big Five trait values from freeâ€‘text input.
- **mindful-tips** â€“ returns daily mindfulâ€‘eating tips tailored to the dominant trait and the userâ€‘selected eating behavior.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samshad/mindful-eating-backend.git
   cd mindful-eating-backend
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Configure environment variables
Create a`.env` file in the project root (refer to `.example.env`):
```env
DATABASE_URL=[URI to your PostgreSQL database]
SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=[URL to your Ollama server]
BIG_FIVE_MODEL=samshad/big5-llama3.2
TIPS_GENERATOR_MODEL=samshad/mindful-tips
```

### Database migrations
Run the following command to apply database migrations:
```bash
  alembic upgrade head
```


## Running with Docker

This application can be easily set up and run using Docker, which ensures consistent environments across different development and deployment setups.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop installations)

### Running the Application with Docker

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method sets up the entire application stack with a single command:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.example.env` template
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
5. To stop the application, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## API Endpoints
Outlined below are a few key endpoints:
- **Authentication routes**: `/auth/*` endpoints for user authentication
- **Question routes**: `/question/*` endpoints for question-related operations
- **Behavior routes**: `/behavior/*` endpoints for behavior-related features
- **Goal routes**: `/goal/*` endpoints for goal management
- **Tips routes**: `/tips/*` endpoints for retrieving tips
- **Food update routes**: `/food-update/*` endpoints for food tracking updates
- **Big Five routes**: `/big-five/*` endpoints related to a "Big Five" feature (dominant personality assessment)

## Contribution Guidelines
